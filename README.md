# What's The Forecast (WTF)

## Technologies Used
* React
* Tailwind CSS

## What I learned:
* Project organization and file structure best practices. Roughly mimmicked the wonderful [guide created by Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/file-structure/#helpers).
* Fetching and processing data from an API (using the ```fetch``` API).
* Working with Local Storage in React to persist user data.
* Implement a working (I hope) search bar with real-time search results.

## Taking it further:
* Implement various user toggles (eg: toggling between Fahrenheit and Celcius).
* Implement a dark mode setting.
